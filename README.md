## Usage/Examples

Defining Variables for the Charts.

```kotlin
  val xReadingMarker by remember {
    mutableStateOf(ChartPoint.pointDataBuilder("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G"))
  }

  val dataSet1 by remember {
    mutableStateOf(listOf(ChartPoint.pointDataBuilder(6f, 5f, 4f, 6f, 7.5f, 7f, 6f)))
  }

  val dataSet2 by remember {
    mutableStateOf(
      listOf(
        ChartPoint.pointDataBuilder(6f, 5f, 4f, 6f, 7.5f, 7f, 6f),
        ChartPoint.pointDataBuilder(3f, 6f, 8f, 2f, 3.5f, 3f, 4f)
      )
    )
  }
```

Making a Simple Line Chart.

```kotlin
  LinearChart.LineChart(
    linearData = LinearStringData(
      yAxisReadings = dataSet1,
        xAxisReadings = xReadingMarker
    )
  )
```

```kotlin
  LinearChart.LineChart(
    linearData = LinearStringData(
      yAxisReadings = dataSet2,
      xAxisReadings = xReadingMarker
    )
  )
```
