## Installation

To Add the dependency into your project first add this to your root build.gradle file

```
dependencyResolutionManagement {
  repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
```

After that add the Dependency 

```
implementation 'com.github.basakjeet08:JetChart:1.1.1'
```
## Usage/Examples

Defining Variables for the Charts.

```Kotlin
  val xReadingMarker by remember {
    mutableStateOf(ChartPoint.pointDataBuilder("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G"))
  }

  val dataSet1 by remember {
    mutableStateOf(listOf(ChartPoint.pointDataBuilder(6f, 5f, 4f, 6f, 7.5f, 7f, 6f)))
  }

  val dataSet2 by remember {
    mutableStateOf(
      listOf(
        ChartPoint.pointDataBuilder(6f, 5f, 4f, 6f, 7.5f, 7f, 6f),
        ChartPoint.pointDataBuilder(3f, 6f, 8f, 2f, 3.5f, 3f, 4f)
      )
    )
  }
```

Making a Simple Line Chart.

```Kotlin
  LinearChart.LineChart(
    linearData = LinearStringData(
      yAxisReadings = dataSet1,
        xAxisReadings = xReadingMarker
    )
  )
```

```Kotlin
  LinearChart.LineChart(
    linearData = LinearStringData(
      yAxisReadings = dataSet2,
      xAxisReadings = xReadingMarker
    )
  )
```
